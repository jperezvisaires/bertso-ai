Para escribir el borrador os recomiendo seguir varias pautas:

    1. Empezad conectando con el lector. Haced preguntas de implicación. Y exponed el tema en un párrafo. (ejemplo)
    2. Presentad brevemente quienes sois y por qué os motiva este proyecto.
    3. Enlazar lo anterior con la técnica a través de una historia. Puede ser vuestra misma historia desde que entráis en AI Saturdays, algo personal o cualquier otro ejemplo.
    4. Explicad de forma ordenada como resolvéis el problema: tipo de problema, datos, exploración, insights, modelo, etc... Lo que habéis aprendido.
    5. Exponed vuestros resultados.
    6. Volved a hacer preguntas de implicación y terminar con los pasos futuros del proyecto.
    7. Añadir link a la ppt, el código en github, la webapp o demo si tenéis..

# Can AI boost tradition?

Tradition, from latin tradere, to transmit, is act of sharing a behavior or belief from generation to generation. And as such, this heritage becomes part of our ourselves, our identity.

Innovation, in contrast, is the introduction of new ideas, of new ways or approaches that change how things were done before. This new approaches are ofthe seen as a threaten to tradition, as the adoption of new methods or behaviors tends to change way that things were done, the tradition.

However, do things need to be always like that? Can innovation be used to leverage and spread tradition among the society?

## Bertso, doinu and neurri a glimpse of the basque tradition

Among the various treasures basque culture has manged to keep alive are **bertsoak**, improvised verses with **rhyme** that are sung following a **doinu**, a melody, that has to match with certain **neurri**, or verse length.

This bertsos are typically sung in front of an audience, and, the **bertsolaris**, the basque rhyme singers, sing about different topics which are provided by the moderator, **gaijartzaile**, while they interact with the rest of bertsolaris (in a rather acid way) in pursue of the public's applause.

How does this look like? Well lets take a look of how a monder bertso saio looks like.

# Doinus: creation and characteristics

Doinus are transmitted from generation to generation, and it is very important for bertsolaris to know them well, because they need to use the doinu suggested by the **gaijartzaile** (moderator) or other bertsolaris .

## How are doinus created?

## Can we improvise over the improvisation?

The cornerstone of a bertso is the improvisation. Bertsoz are like rap, the [batalla de gallos] happens on the fly, there is no script to follow. However, the base, the doinu, is already known by everyone, it is something fixed, rigid.

Which is a pity? Isnt it? If improvisation is part of the great art of the bertsolari... Why not providing an improvised doinu so that bertso experience becomes even more challenging and unique?

With these thoughts in mind, and with the

Could bertolarsim be revolutionized with the use of AI? Could it help and motivate the

## GANS where technology and tradition (could) meet


With the insightful courses we had during the SaturdayAI lessons, we learned about the latest innovations on the field of Deep Learning, such as the different architectures, convolutional, recurrent, autoencoder... as well as the different uses such as the reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learnning.

The quesion at this point was, could the magic of generative adversarial networks used to create different things such as images, [filter etc etc] to create new doinus?
